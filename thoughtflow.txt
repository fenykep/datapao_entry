check if imdb has one simple page with all req details (no)
check for api - omdbapi - no imdb ratersnum
prepare for bad case: linkjumping w/js o python
datasets.imdbws.com - no oscar
aws something - prolly this'd've be my job but seems scary 
at this point its either linkhopping or combining different apis
use gui or cli // almost a joke
start with js
let konti = document.getElementsByClassName("lister-list")[0]
let gyerkocok = konti.children
get title, id, rating, link of first 20
foreach open link (id/awards, id/ratings)
check if mainpage always has that tiny flag thing stating no oscars
yes, so just id/ratings
