check if imdb has one simple page with all req details (no)
check for api - omdbapi - no imdb ratersnum
datasets.imdbws.com - no oscar
aws something - prolly this'd've be my job but seems scary 
at this point its either linkhopping or combining different apis
start with js
let konti = document.getElementsByClassName("lister-list")[0]
let gyerkocok = konti.children
get title, id, rating, link of first 20
foreach open link (id/awards, id/ratings)
check if mainpage always has that tiny flag thing stating no oscars
yes, so just id/ratings

ruby, python, bash-ish at scope
